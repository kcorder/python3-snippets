# python3-snippets
Collection of saved bits of code that will probably be useful again. Stuff like plotting, template classes for things, etc. 

## Files 
- `plot_tb_csv.py`: combine tensorboard CSVs into an aggregate curve 
- `Plotting.ipynb`: similar code to the above, but loops for easily plotting multiple curves to same figure and multiple figures
